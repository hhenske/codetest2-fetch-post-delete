# codetest2-fetch-post-delete

I actually have done this before with JavaScript, so I stuck with that and displayed in a quick html file

The instructions said the most recent 200 entries, but there are only 200 entries. If more are added, the program will fetch the first 200.  In order to only get the most
recent, this won't work.  I would have to do a mapping function or a method maybe.  If I have time, I will rework that, maybe using just the most recent 20 for testing.

Also, if I have time, I'm sure that the code could be re-worked to be more dry.  I shouldn't have to fetch the same data 3 times.
